Hence, anxiety.</p>\n\n        <p id=\"pp\">The stress from junior year of high school has made its way back in the form of internships and jobs instead of SATs and college \n        applications. Pressure to prepare for our future swells as we strive for pixel-perfect portfolios, well-groomed resumes, solid slide decks, \n        and rewarding referrals.</p>\n        <p id=\"section\">Improving Imperfections</p>\n        <p id=\"pp\">We know better than anyone else how products need to be continuously iterated and tested to determine whether it solves the \n        identified problem and is a delightful experience or not. When we apply that to portfolios, we will never feel good enough. There’s always \n        something to improve. External feedback will queue behind the long line of internal criticism until you’re too overwhelmed to improve anything. \n        But time is ticking. Midterms are back in town, and the well of opportunities will dry after winter.</p>\n        <p className=\"quote\">\"When you're applying for jobs, imposter syndrome is so real, especially for design, because it feels like nothing’s done. \n        ‘Oh I’ll apply next week when I’m done with my portfolio this week.’</p> \n        <p className=\"quoteL\">It’s still not ready.</p> \n        <p className=\"quoteL\">Because of that, I missed out on a lot of opportunities. My advice for designers: just go for it. It’ll never be done, so just apply.\"</p>\n        <p id=\"pp\">Even if we’ve cleverly packaged our design process into a parsable page on our portfolio, the contents are still concealed by the exterior. \n        That is, our visual design skills will still be a sore spot for many of us. People assume that design means we’re artistically inclined, but if only \n        they knew the truth. Without any formal classes, our skills derive from our observations, replications, and modifications of work that came \n        from better visual designers. We’re aware of the weaknesses that come with our constrained curriculum, but despite all of the time and effort \n        we contributed to developing our visual design skills, we might still feel lacking compared to our competition.</p>\n        <p className=\"quote\">\"I had low self-esteem and lacked direction in what I was doing. My fear was that I wasn’t a good enough designer, \n        especially because I wasn’t good enough at visual design.\"</p>\n\n        <p id=\"imgTitle\">📌 DSGN 100 A2 Splash Page Design - Final Stage Submissions</p>\n        <img src={DSGN100} alt=\"Four poster designs from DSGN 100\" className=\"responsive\" />\n        <p id=\"imgCap\">As a 2nd year, I knew that my visual design skills were severely lacking compared to my classmates. I knew what good \n        aesthetics looked like, I just couldn’t create them.</p>\n\n        <p id=\"imgTitle\">📌 RA Instagram Posts for Resident Newsletters and Socials</p>\n        <img src={RA} alt=\"Instagram posts for residents\" className=\"responsive\" />\n        <p id=\"imgCap\">As a 3rd year, I became more familiar with Figma as I experimented with different designs in a more low-stake setting.</p>\n\n        <p id=\"imgTitle\">📌 Portfolios Through Time</p>\n        <div className=\"allPortfolios\">\n          <div className=\"portfolios\">\n            <p id=\"imgCap2\">1st year Spring Quarter - COGS 3 Final</p>\n            <img src={portfolio1} alt=\"Year 1 portfolio\" className=\"responsive\" />\n            <p id=\"imgCap2\">3rd year Winter Quarter - Internship Hunt</p>\n            <img src={portfolio3} alt=\"Year 3 portfolio\" className=\"responsive\" />\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"portfolios\">\n            <p id=\"imgCap2\">2nd year Spring Quarter - COGS 121 Final</p>\n            <img src={portfolio2} alt=\"Year 2 portfolio\" className=\"responsive\" />\n            <p id=\"imgCap2\">3rd year Spring Quarter - Before COGS 121 IAship</p>\n            <img src={portfolio4} alt=\"Year 3 portfolio, post-internship\" className=\"responsive\" />\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p id=\"imgCap\">In the moment, I was always hard on myself for lacking confidence in my work, especially when I saw what other students could do on Cofolios or Bestfolios.\n         Reflecting on my past work has given me a different perspective, though. I was just trying my best and figuring myself out. Each attempt was a step forward.</p>\n\n        <p id=\"pp\">And so our dilemma resumes - improvement takes time, but deadlines for jobs are knocking on our doors. We can cue the frantic \n        montage of us hoarding Medium articles, studying Figma tutorials, soliciting feedback, and having the occasional mental breakdown, but the \n        question is, to shoot our shot or not with what we’ve got?</p>\n        <p id=\"pp\">People will continue to use poorly-designed products if it meets their needs, and that could apply to our portfolios too. Maybe \n        it’s not ideal to have basic slides or simple designs, but if we know our truth - that we’re capable of creating impact by understanding user \n        needs and defending our design decisions - we can still make good impressions. Design encompasses critical thinking, problem-solving, and \n        collaboration. Not just visuals.</p>\n\n        <p id=\"imgTitle\">📌 Slide Deck from UX Design Internship Interview with Amazon</p>\n        <img src={slide} alt=\"Slide deck template - Importance title\" className=\"responsive\" />\n        <p id=\"imgCap\">The product of procrastinating on my slide deck the night before my interview.</p>\n\n        <p className=\"quote\">\"The days leading up to my interview were mentally and physically taxing. Everyone told me not to put too much pressure on \n        myself, and I knew that this was just one interview. I knew that, but I was so stressed. The best I could do at the time was create a basic slide \n        deck with a Google Slides template, get enough sleep, and just show up.</p>\n        <p className=\"quoteL\">Of course, the interview wasn’t perfect. I got feedback on reducing the amount of bullet points and showing more visual \n        examples of my final product, but there were no comments on my capabilities to connect to customers or tell a story. This banal slide \n        unexpectedly became my pride, because it was good enough.</p>\n        <p className=\"quoteL\">If I didn’t apply to this internship because it was posted 3 months ago or because I didn’t have a great slide deck on standby, \n        I wouldn’t have gotten that offer to be a UX Design intern.\"</p>\n\n        <p id=\"pp\">The point is that we may not ever feel ready to share a portfolio, a resume, or a slide deck whose flaws we know so intimately, \n        but it’s worth a shot to try. Everything is a work in progress, and you miss 100% of the shots you don’t take. Besides, what’s the worst that \n        could happen?</p>\n\n        <p id=\"section\">Rejections</p>\n        <p id=\"pp\">Rejections suck.</p>\n\n        <p id=\"pp\">Our hearts sink, our vision blurs, our minds jumble. It just feels personal, like proof that we’re not good enough. \n        We know all the time that went into preparing for everything, so it’s disheartening we’re met with regret instead of congratulations. \n        What went wrong? Our resume, our portfolio, our interview, our selves, our timing, our luck?</p>\n\n        <p id=\"imgTitle\">📌 Rejection Collection</p>\n        <img src={rejecc} alt=\"Email screenshots of rejections\" className=\"responsive\" />\n        <p id=\"imgCap\">From on-campus opportunities to internships, rejection is no stranger.</p>\n        <p className=\"quote\">\"My friends hype me up and tell me that I’m good enough, but when I get rejected, I feel otherwise.”</p>\n        <p id=\"pp\">When you get rejected from opportunities because you lack experience, it hurts. You can’t wait for classes to give you experience, \n        but you don’t feel prepared for those opportunities right now, either. Motivation to make your own opportunities in your free time can help, \n        but it’s also a fleeting feeling that dwindles during midterm season and breaks. What do we do then?</p>\n        <p id=\"pp\">Coping mechanisms vary from rebellious respites from the world to revengeful strides toward other opportunities. We carry on with \n        the mindset of, “keep trying, keep applying, and keep moving forward.” Eventually, we’ll open LinkedIn to push past this hiccup and reboot our \n        job search, but everything changed when social comparisons attacked, yet again.</p>\n        <p className=\"quote\">“When I look at other people’s success, I’m happy for them, but I can’t stop thinking to myself, \n        ‘Why can’t I achieve the same results?’ We’re taking the same classes, but why am I still stuck?”</p>\n        <p id=\"pp\">Sometimes, it feels wrong to be envious of others.</p>\n        <p id=\"pp\">Truth is, the lessons from our lived experiences lack visibility. We’ve all experienced rejection at some point, but there’s no \n        rejection section on LinkedIn to clarify the pristine path of linear experiences we present. The choices we’ve made aren’t exactly the choices we \n        endorse, but there’s no confession corner on our resume either.</p>\n        \n        <p id=\"pp\">On those days when disappointment and regret drench our minds and moods, we’ll be patient with ourselves. We’ll scribble a mental \n        note to remember that rejection and failure don’t define us or measure our self-worth. Even after rejection, we can still sip on that \n        celebratory boba we promised ourselves because the fact that we showed up and tried is a win.</p>\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"bottomNav\">\n        <div>\n        <Link to=\"/BehindTheGrind\">← Behind the Grind</Link>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n        <a href=\"#top\">Scroll to Top</a>\n        </div>\n\n        <div>\n        <Link to=\"/LivingLife\">Living Life →</Link>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n \nexport default Jobs;"],"names":["className","to","props","id","src","Journal","alt","DSGN100","RA","portfolio1","portfolio3","portfolio2","portfolio4","slide","rejecc","href"],"sourceRoot":""}
