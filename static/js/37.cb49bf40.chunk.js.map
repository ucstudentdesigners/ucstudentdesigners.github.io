I thought this was an intro class.\"</p>\n        <p id=\"pp\">The self-made grind is a survival skill, but it perpetuates an illusion where everyone knows what they’re doing, except for you. \n        As a result, you feel behind. Regrets of not starting earlier, not knowing sooner, and not trying harder come as dense clouds. You want to \n        improve, but it seems like you’re not good enough to get the experiences you need.</p>\n        <p id=\"pp\">It’s difficult to know exactly how people are spending their time in-between classes. We’re extracted from our personal context \n        during class and assessed on our current capabilities. No insight into our process or how we distribute our hours in the day. Yet, we still \n        feel behind because we have a general awareness of what is expected of us - do well in classes → gain experiences → form networks → get an \n        internship → graduate → get a job.</p>\n        <p className=\"quote\">\"I felt like I wasn’t doing enough, so I needed to do more because I was comparing myself to people who were doing what \n        I was interested in.\"</p>\n        <p id=\"pp\">Social comparison is condemned for being unproductive and harmful, but when you’re navigating a new career path like design, \n        you rely on research and observations of upperclassmen and alumni to inform your decisions. It’s accessible, seemingly authentic inspiration \n        that can motivate you to reach your north stars. At the same time, comparison can accentuate insecurities, imposter syndrome, envy, and anxiety. \n        Maybe you’ve been told to assuage your self-sabotage with mantras like</p>\n        <p className=\"quote1\">Compare yourself to your past self, and see how you’ve grown.</p>\n        <p className=\"quote1\">You’re comparing your behind-the-scenes to everyone’s highlight reel.</p>\n        <p className=\"quote1\">Someone’s success doesn’t indicate a lack of your own.</p>\n        <p className=\"quote1\">Comparison is the thief of joy.</p>\n        <p className=\"quote1\">Practice gratitude.</p>\n        <p className=\"quote1\">Just stop.</p>\n        <p id=\"pp\">They’re not magical spells that will make your troubling thoughts disappear forever, though. It’s still hard sometimes to remind \n        yourself that no one has lived your life before. Your challenges and circumstances are unique, but you’re not alone in feeling like you’re not \n        enough. It’s the residue from trying to figure out life as a fellow human.</p>\n        <p id=\"section\">Quarter System</p>\n        <p className=\"quote\">\"I was so desperate to find experience, but as a result, I subconsciously tied my self-worth to my lack of experience. \n        When I got my hands on any experience, I would hoard them until I burnt out.\"</p>\n        <p id=\"pp\">Hustle culture is embedded into the quarter system. Classes always want to hit the ground running until our brakes become too dull \n        to stop and breaks from the daily grind become awkward. It’s the restlessness from seeing a sparse portfolio then procrastinating on it during \n        break because we’re burnt out. It’s the endless deadlines from school that blur the boundaries of our life and our responsibilities. It’s the way \n        summer break isn’t a leisurely indulgence but a looming reminder that we need to find an internship.</p>\n        <p className=\"quote\">“'How was break?' Not productive.\"</p>\n        <p id=\"pp\">Sometimes, it feels like we always have to be doing something. Make progress towards our career goals, work around obstacles, \n        create our own opportunities. College is what we make of it, after all. Ambition, passion, and resilience seem to be the key ingredients to \n        success, but the pandemic<a id=\"fn10\" href=\"#fn-10\"><sup>10</sup></a> decimated the pantry.</p>\n        <p className=\"quote\">\"My goal isn’t to become the smartest student or the best designer, but even being an average student or a decent designer \n        takes a lot of effort.\"</p>\n        <img src={Best} alt=\"Pokemon - don't wanna be the very best\" className=\"responsive2 Doodle\" />\n        <p id=\"pp\">We’re tired now.
