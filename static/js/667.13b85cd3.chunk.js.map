Your stories have stayed with me, and I appreciate the trust and kindness\n        you all generously gave me. You helped make this!! This is your win too :)</p>\n        <p id=\"pp\">This could not have been possible without the support and guidance of my advisor, Philip Guo. I still can’t believe I had the \n        opportunity to just make something cool during my senior year. Thank you for trusting me and helping me learn to enjoy the messy process \n        that is research.</p>\n        <p id=\"pp\">Thank you to all my friends for letting me take notes during our conversations and believing in me. I truly believe that the \n        success and happiness I’ve found in my life was because of the love and support you gave me.</p>\n        <p id=\"pp\">Special thanks to Kendall for looking out for me and hyping me up. Design is therapy, indeed.</p>\n        <p id=\"pp\">Kela, you were the first to encourage me to make the switch from pre-med to UX. Even when I lacked confidence in myself, you \n        advocated for me, and I wouldn’t be where I am without you.</p>\n        <p id=\"pp\">Alina, you kept me company when we were both sprawled on our couch, contemplative of whether we were the shit or just straight \n        up shit. Through all our rough drafts, we made it.</p>\n        <p id=\"pp\">Shoutout to all the candles burned, albums played, teas consumed, feelings hoarded, memoirs read, and snacks purchased that made this possible.</p>\n        <br></br>\n        <p id=\"pp\">Published May 2022</p>\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"bottomNav\">\n        <div>\n        <Link to=\"/Resources\">← Resources</Link>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n        <a href=\"#top\">Scroll to Top</a>\n        </div>\n\n        <div>\n        <Link to=\"/AboutTheAuthor\">About →</Link>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n \nexport default Acknowledgments;"],"names":["className","to","props","id","href"],"sourceRoot":""}
