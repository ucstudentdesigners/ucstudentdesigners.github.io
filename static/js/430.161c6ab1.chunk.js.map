We want community and social interaction as people and as design students who can learn from each other. \n        We seek friends who can mutually cherish the fond memories of staying up late on a Figma file, smelling like smoke after a beach bonfire, sinking \n        into a food coma at Convoy, or consoling the fears of post-grad plans. We want to feel belonging, comfort, and empowerment from the company of \n        others.</p>\n        <p id=\"pp\">Connection can be only a few clicks away to a Zoom link that opens a GBM or lecture, but the lurking fatigue wrecks \n        your internal architecture. There are many days where it’s hard to get out of bed or focus on assignments. Serendipitous encounters with other \n        students have dwindled. It’s year two of the pandemic, and our bodies are keeping score. Amidst the stress, anxiety, and confusion, surviving the \n        day is enough.</p>\n        <p id=\"pp\">Sometimes, it feels like being human is our last priority. There’s guilt associated with choosing to indulge in hobbies, do nothing \n        over break, or hang out with friends instead of pulling our shit together to be proper adults. Happiness is delayed to the future and morphs \n        into a dangling incentive to continue grinding for that internship or job. This is reinforced when people tell us that hard work pays off. If \n        we can flip the script for our families and earn steady incomes as creatives, we’ve made it.</p>\n        \n        <p className=\"quote\">“I thought that if I worked hard, I could achieve great things. I kept sleeping at 5am just grinding it out, \n        learning new tools, and making my portfolio. It wasn’t until I spent more time with my friends that I realized that there’s more to life than just  \n        working.”</p>\n\n        <img src={rest} alt=\"Pokemon - don't wanna be the very best\" className=\"responsive2 Doodle\" />\n\n        <p id=\"pp\">How can we design for people if we can’t nourish ourselves as individuals first? The non-design, non-career, non-academic aspects \n        of life that make us feel fulfilled - they don’t need to be neglected or sacrificed for the sake of swole salaries and societal expectations. \n        The time that’s invested in observing the world, making small and personal wins, or resting on weekends is an investment in our wellbeing.</p>\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"bottomNav\">\n        <div>\n        <Link to=\"/Jobs\">← Job Hunting</Link>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n        <a href=\"#top\">Scroll to Top</a>\n        </div>\n\n        <div>\n        <Link to=\"/Reflection\">Reflection →</Link>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n \nexport default LivingLife;"],"names":["className","to","props","id","src","rest","alt","href"],"sourceRoot":""}
