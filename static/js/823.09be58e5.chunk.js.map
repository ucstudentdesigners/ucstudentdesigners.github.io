We might be influenced by how our family and friends define success, what \n        sparks joy in us, our personal values, exposure to enriching activities and potential career paths, or simply societal expectations. However deliberate \n        we are with the details of those north stars, we revisit them to evaluate where we currently are and where we want to go. </p>\n        <p id=\"section\">Career</p>\n        <p className=\"quote\">‚ÄúAs much as I wanna do what I wanna do, the stability of a job lingers in my head. My parents don‚Äôt really care what I do as long \n        as I make good money.‚Äù</p>\n        <p id=\"pp\">Inquisitive strangers and nosy relatives will incessantly pester you on what you want to be when you grow up. Explaining UX Design\n         requires some patience, but here is a brief summary to help you out.</p>\n        <p id=\"pp\">UX Designers, Researchers, Writers, Engineers, and Managers strive to help people meet their goals. People could be customers, business stakeholders, \n        or cross-functional partners. Design careers generally emphasize design thinking and the process of exploring, ideating, testing, and refining ideas \n        based on research and feedback. Collaboration, creativity, curiosity, problem-solving, and real-world impact are attributes we want for our careers to \n        feel fulfilling. </p>\n        <p id=\"pp\">Furthermore, design careers are not exclusive to the tech industry. Big tech companies boast their influence on how we perceive and \n        interact with the world, but design opportunities and impact exist in healthcare, government agencies, non-profits, and service design too. \n        This means that we have options in where we work and how we want to make an impact.</p>\n        <p id=\"pp\">UX Designers earn an annual average salary of $115,743 in the United States as of 2022<a id=\"fn3\" href=\"#fn-3\"><sup>3</sup></a>. Simply put, money means mobility. \n        Job security and financial stability contribute to our independence and basic necessities as young adults. These jobs are attainable for \n        new graduates like us. Graduate school becomes an option rather than a necessity like medical school or law school, for example.</p>\n        <p id=\"pp\">So, those strangers and relatives can rest assured knowing that you‚Äôre not pursuing an art degree despite being incapable of \n        drawing a convincing circle.</p>\n        <p id=\"section\">Education</p>\n        <p className=\"quote\">‚ÄúBack in community college, my major was psychology, but if you don‚Äôt go to grad school, chances of employment are low. \n        I thought I would have a better job and opportunity at a UC.‚Äù</p>\n        <p id=\"pp\">In search of identity, community, and opportunity, we find ourselves situated at UCSD with a specialization in Design and Interaction. Let‚Äôs unpack that.</p>\n        <p id=\"pp\">UCSD carries the legacies of the first Cognitive Science department and The Design Lab. Browse through LinkedIn or the COGS website, \n        and you‚Äôll find several alumni who have secured design jobs with their Human-Computer Interaction or Design and Interaction degree since 2007\n        <a id=\"fn4\" href=\"#fn-4\"><sup>4</sup></a>. This should be a confidence booster because if they can do it, you can too, right?</p>\n        <p id=\"pp\">There would be an abundance of opportunities to discover our interests, gain experience, and leverage our network to reach our goals. \n        We would feel confident and qualified for internships, entry-level jobs, graduate school, or whatever we strive for because we were prepared by \n        classes, research, extracurriculars, and mentors.</p>\n        <p id=\"pp\">Most importantly, the community of design students at UCSD would be a source of support, empowerment, and growth throughout our \n        design journey. Friendships and mentorships are deemed essential to the trademark college experience, even at a school that‚Äôs reputed to be \n        UC Socially Dead. That‚Äôs why student organizations create opportunities for us to connect with fellow student designers. Through all of these \n        interactions, we hope to see our peers as contributors to our success and happiness, rather than sources of competition and resentment.</p>\n        <p id=\"section\">Personal</p>\n        <p className=\"quote\">‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt have a north star. I was worried that I wouldn‚Äôt find my way through college or the future.‚Äù</p>\n        <p id=\"pp\">At the intersection of education and occupation, there‚Äôs a promised future of financial stability and independence. If we just work hard, \n        balance the stress of school and job hunting with our personal needs, and get enough sleep, we‚Äôll get there by the time we graduate. We would lead \n        our lives with our passions, purpose, values, and goals, so if an interviewer suddenly asks, we would have a compelling answer worthy of employment.</p>\n        <p id=\"bold\">But, if the present is burdened with preparing for that future, when do we get to live?</p>\n        <p id=\"pp\">This is our first time living this life. We won‚Äôt know all the answers to our questions, nor the outcomes of our goals, \n        yet we live in a world where knowledge is instantaneously accessible. A Google search can show the sagely advice of what you should do, \n        signed by the people before you. It‚Äôs not the antidote to your existential crises, though.</p>\n        <p id=\"pp\">The truth is, we may carry our north stars in a pocket close to our heart, but life happens and distorts our direction.</p>\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"footnote\">\n        <p id=\"fn-3\">3.&ensp;<a className=\"outLink\" href=\"https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/user-experience-designer-salary-SRCH_KO0,24.htm\" \n          target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Salary: User Experience Designer (April, 2022) | Glassdoor &#8599;</a>&ensp;\n        <a href=\"#fn3\">(üîé)</a>\n        </p>\n        <p id=\"fn-4\">4.&ensp;<a className=\"outLink\" href=\"https://cogsci.ucsd.edu/undergraduates/advising/after-graduation.html#2007\" \n          target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">What Do UCSD CogSci Students Do After Graduation? &#8599;</a>&ensp;\n        <a href=\"#fn4\">(üîé)</a>\n        </p>\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"bottomNav\">\n        <div>\n        <Link to=\"/StartingPoint\">‚Üê Starting Point</Link>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n        <a href=\"#top\">Scroll to Top</a>\n        </div>\n\n        <div>\n        <Link to=\"/Opportunities\">Finding Opportunities ‚Üí</Link>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n \nexport default NorthStars;"],"names":["className","to","props","id","href","target","rel"],"sourceRoot":""}
