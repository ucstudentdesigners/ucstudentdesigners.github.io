You analyze cyborgs, profanity, and poorly designed doors, but you also rehash \n        action potentials and neuroanatomy until your brain cells become more self-aware than specialized to design think. The curriculum is on brand \n        for an interdisciplinary major, but it’s a reality check that design is only a specialization and a minor. Neither a department, nor a major of its own.</p>\n        <p id=\"pp\">Assuming you spend at least 5 hours a week per class (attending lectures and sections, completing assignments, studying, taking \n      exams) for 11 weeks, you would have spent roughly 880 hours to complete your 16 non-design classes. Compared to the 385 hours you’re expected to \n      contribute to your 7 design classes, there’s clearly a reason why you feel underprepared for a design role. That’s time that could’ve been spent \n      practicing Figma, learning visual design and branding, creating a portfolio, and applying to internships - everything we have to do outside of \n      class to compensate for this curriculum imbalance.</p>\n        <p id=\"pp\">Design classes at UCSD excel in introducing the foundations of design thinking. For most classes like DSGN 1, DSGN 100, and COGS 187A, \n        you’ll work in groups to blast through the double diamond and conclude with a product that attempts to solve a problem. This holistic, quick-paced \n        approach encourages us to be well-rounded designers who take ownership of the entire design process, but very few classes emphasize how each part of \n        the design process can be further dissected.</p>\n        <p className=\"quote\">Upper-div design classes are like DSGN 1 on steroids.</p>\n        <p id=\"pp\">Have you ever taken a class on content writing, motion design, product management, storytelling, or user research methods? \n        How about design ethics, accessibility, or privacy? Surely you’ve taken a class where everyone in your group project is the UX Designer, \n        and your final project doesn’t make it to your portfolio. Design careers carry the responsibility of advocating for the user, so why aren’t \n        we more prepared to discuss our intentions and impact of our work? Seeds of imposter syndrome are sewn into our psyche when we compare ourselves \n        to student designers from other schools and realize the limits of our self-taught skills. Classes should help us learn what matters to us, but the \n        lack of exposure to our career options forges a narrow path: become a UX Designer or perish.</p>\n        <p id=\"pp\">There are great design classes like DSGN 118, 160, COGS 127, and 128, but they’re only offered once a year. In fact, with the \n        exception of DSGN 1 and DSGN 100, all our design electives are offered once a year during a specific quarter. No one tells you during \n        orientation to frequently consult with the course offerings schedule<a id=\"fn5\" href=\"#fn-5\"><sup>5</sup></a>, but it’s a survival skill you need. If you have a later enrollment \n        time or need to prioritize other classes on your first-pass, you’re fucked. For transfers who feel a time pressure to make the most of their \n        two years, the limited class offerings and long waitlists are demoralizing. If you can’t get into COGS 121 or 127 due to high demand, you have \n        to wait another year to get a supportive classroom environment that prepares you for job hunting or muster what little motivation you have to \n        write case studies and reach out to people for feedback on your own time. The disparity is disheartening.</p>\n        <p className=\"quote\">Waitlists are huge, and transfers are at a disadvantage with later enrollment times.</p>\n        <p id=\"pp\">Classes are a great starting point, but we can’t entirely rely on them to reach our north stars. Our curriculum leans heavily \n        toward cognitive science principles, design classes lack diversity in topics, and classes that do offer unique topics have sparse availability. \n        Our formal education alone isn’t enough to prepare us, but we can’t wait for the department to implement the changes we need.</p>\n\n        <p id=\"section\">Extracurriculars</p>\n        <p id=\"pp\">As job seekers, we’re expected to advertise our inherent uniqueness and design acumen through our experiences. Excessive pressure \n        is placed on extracurriculars to provide the experiences we lack from our education and distinguish ourselves as applicants. Getting involved \n        is especially complicated if you’re unsure of how to find relevant opportunities at a large public university<a id=\"fn6\" href=\"#fn-6\"><sup>6</sup></a>.</p>\n        <p id=\"pp\">If you’re first-gen, you hope to receive support as you balance the expectations imposed on you and strive to live instead of \n        simply surviving. If you’re a transfer and/or recently switched into the major, you want to know the path of least resistance to make the \n        most of your time here. If you’re an international student or out-of-state, you need to ensure that your investment in UCSD yields \n        opportunities, experiences, and work visas that make the hefty tuition costs worth it.</p>\n        <p id=\"pp\">To save you some hours of LinkedIn stalking, I’ll tell you now that design students usually find opportunities by asking others \n        for referrals or saying yes to any opportunity that falls in their radar (emails, newsletters, Facebook posts, guest speakers, \n        club recruitment, etc.).</p>\n        <p id=\"pp\">Typical on-campus jobs with UX or graphic-related responsibilities include: ArtPower, University Center, Geisel Library, \n        RIMAC, student councils from the seven colleges (Sixth/TMC/ERC, etc.), Resident Assistant, Instructional Apprenticeship (IA, unpaid), \n        and The Basement startups (usually unpaid).</p>\n        <p id=\"pp\">Research opportunities with The Design Lab and its partners are commonly found through recruitment forms on Facebook and Slack, \n        guest lectures, referrals from students currently in a lab, professor office hours, professor recruitment at the end of the quarter, and \n        contact with current researchers. Independent research under a professor generally comes from establishing a rapport with them through office \n        hours or being an IA.</p>\n        <p id=\"pp\">Student orgs like Design Co, Design for America (DFA), Hue Collective, Cognitive Science Student Association (CSSA), AdWave, \n        Product Space, Triton Software Engineering (TSE), Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), Women in Computing (WIC), and even non-design \n        orgs provide leadership roles or host GBMs that facilitate your growth as a student designer and cultivate a sense of community.</p>\n        <p id=\"pp\">In addition to any involvement, our side job includes navigating Figma, Medium articles, website builders, portfolios, \n        case studies, mentorships, networking, and personal projects. We’re taking ownership of our college education despite the lack of career \n        preparation we feel from our classes.</p>\n        <p id=\"pp\">Call it resilience or resourcefulness - we’re willing to do the best we can with what we have. The plethora of extracurricular \n        opportunities yields optimism at best, but this self-service approach to design resources is an accessibility problem. We don’t know what \n        we don’t know.</p>\n        <p id=\"pp\">We directly experience the disproportion of students to available seats, leadership roles, and research projects. These lost \n        opportunities then manifest into a lack of awareness and confidence about design job hunting etiquette. Without active outreach to students, \n        it feels lonely sometimes when we’re left to forage for these fragments of knowledge.</p>        \n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"footnote\">\n        <p id=\"fn-5\">5.&ensp;<a className=\"outLink\" href=\"https://cogsci.ucsd.edu/undergraduates/courses/index.html\" \n          target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tentative Course Offerings for COGS and DSGN 2021-22 &#8599;</a>&ensp;\n        <a href=\"#fn5\">(🔎)</a>\n        </p>\n        <p id=\"fn-6\">6. 31,842 total undergraduates, 2,098 enrolled in Cognitive Science |&ensp;\n        <a className=\"outLink\" href=\"https://ir.ucsd.edu/undergrad/publications/ug-student-profile.html\" \n          target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">UCSD Student Profile 2021-22 &#8599;</a>&ensp;\n        <a href=\"#fn6\">(🔎)</a>\n        </p>\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"bottomNav\">\n        <div>\n        <Link to=\"/NorthStars\">← North Stars</Link>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n        <a href=\"#top\">Scroll to Top</a>\n        </div>\n\n        <div>\n        <Link to=\"/BehindTheGrind\">Behind the Grind →</Link>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n \nexport default Opportunities;"],"names":["className","to","props","id","href","target","rel"],"sourceRoot":""}
